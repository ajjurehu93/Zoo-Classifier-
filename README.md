# Zoo-Classifier-
Creating a simple Zoo classifier using Neural Networks 

here you will learn how to pull in images from your local system, preprocess it, and convert to numpy arrays to use in our neural networks

We will be using a simple Neural network to build our model. Though Convolution NN is recomended, we will just use a simple NN as this will help beginners.
